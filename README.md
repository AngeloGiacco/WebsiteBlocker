# WebsiteBlocker

This website will block certain websites between certain times of the day by manipulating the hosts file in macs. 

To learn more about hosts files visit this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)

By mapping domains to the localhost in the host file, they can essentially be blocked. 

This was made after following a course by Ardit Sulce (https://www.udemy.com/user/adiune/) on Udemy.
